# basicProject

# SDLC steps of the project:

# Requirement analysis:
In this phase I read the questions and understand what we are required to do, what is the current problem we have to solve?. We have to write many functions and codes, 
for reading and writing files, we have to we have to decrypt an encrypted file, and then we have to but the oroginal text and the decrypted text in one file. 
For this last file that contains both texts (encrypted and decrypted), we have to count the number of lines, and to find the longest words and put them in a list,
we have to return the list and the number of lines.
We have to create a repository on github to connect our local one -of the project- to it with enabling our lecturer to access to it. After that we have to cretae 
a README.md file (this file) to descripe the SDLC
steps we did in this project.
The last step we have to do is to make a PULL REQUEST and to set our lecturer as a viewer.

# Planning:
In this phase i started to try many codes and functions in order to implement the requirements. I used many sourses of data to helpme understanding how to implement 
the codes, like lectures, youtube vedioes and toturilas, to help me understand better what is really required in the project.

# Software design, such as architectural design:
No design in this project! This is not a product. The only design here is the code design?

# Software development:
I this phase I solved the parts of the project using the gathered data and soourses from the previous phases.

# Testing:
The testing in the poject that I made is to check some stepd with print() function to check if I get the right result to continue.
Anothe test is that I made an additional repository in github to check how to connect to the local one, before to connect to the final repository to fix mistakes if 
founs to reach to the requirements of the project.

# Deployment:
This project is only solving some codes and put everything on github, there is no use for the project, and the only use is for lecturer to check the project.
